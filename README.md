# WorkDayScheduler
#### This is the repository for Homework 5, due December 12th, 2020.

### For this assignment, I have used the provided files and created a Javascipt file for DOM manipulation of the HTML. This application allows users to create a schedule for a work day.
    * The schedule displays the current date, and is broken down by each hour 9 AM - 5 PM.
    * The user can click on each time slot, and enter text describing their schedule item.
        * Once they click the save button, their text will be saved to local storage, and can be retrieved even once the page is refreshed.
        * The user can also edit text that has been previously entered.
    * The calendar shows the hours color coded by past (grey), present (red), and future (green).
    * The user can clear their entire schedule using the button under the heading.
